[Jim Butterfield](http://www.commodore.ca/history/people/jim_butterfield_compute_sept82.htm) died last night at 1:30 in the morning, from complications from cancer. He inspired many a geek who hacked their way through Commodore 64's in the old days. He certainly helped me explore the inner workings of computers, and he will be missed.  
  
The sad thing is that he leaves with a whimper, when he was such an influential person in the 80's, in that scene. Anyone who opened a copy of COMPUTE, COMPUTE's Gazette, or RUN knows who he is, and how brilliant he was.  
  
My best wishes to his family. Know that he left his mark on so many people, and he will be remembered.
