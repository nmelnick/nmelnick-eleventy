Hey, welcome to the new nicholasmelnick.com, largely the same as the old nicholasmelnick.com.

Given that the [Ambition Framework](http://www.ambitionframework.com) has gone to sleep, and I've largely stopped hobby development on Vala, it was about time that I both migrate my blog away from [Parchment](https://github.com/AmbitionFramework/ambition/tree/master/examples/Parchment), and also merge together some of the other blogs I've maintained over the past few years.

While I'm not the biggest fan of WordPress, it provided two things that I really wanted out of a writing platform -- a solid history of maintenance and security updates, and the ability to host comments without too much pain. Here we are.
