After some thought and paging through many years of old, outdated technical advice, I have migrated my blog to a new domain with a bit of a fresh start. Because I never want to let go of what I've said in the past, I kept a few entries around for grins, but will start fresh and new from here on forward.

Welcome to my new blog.

The main reason I'm writing here is to share thoughts and elicit some conversation about modern development on the web and in the cloud, using old and tired technology, as well as new and busted technology. With any luck, none of the entries will end with "get off my lawn".
