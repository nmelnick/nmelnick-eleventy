I will be presenting the [Ambition MVC Framework](http://www.ambitionframework.org) at TCCC15. [Twin Cities Code Camp](http://www.twincitiescodecamp.com/TCCC/Default.aspx) is a free event that occurs twice a year at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, MN, and it caters to novice to advanced developers using multiple languages and devices. TCCC15 will be held on October 19th, 2013, starting at 8:00am, and you can [register here](http://tccc15.eventbrite.com/).

The synopsis of my talk:

There are tons of great MVC web frameworks out in the wild, for most major compiled and dynamic languages. They're great tools to get projects prototyped and quickly into production. The Ambition MVC framework is a hobby that turned into a reasonable web framework. Written using Vala, the Ambition framework allows a developer or team of developers to create web applications or RESTful services using a static-typed object oriented language without relying on a VM or a garbage collection cycle. Plus, being compiled, it allows cloud deployment to be easy and inexpensive, as memory and CPU requirements can be a fraction of PHP, Ruby, Python, or Perl sites. While it's not "officially" released, it's available on GitHub, and being actively developed. Patches, help, and end users are very welcome, and I'd like to show you more.
