I keep finding myself in situations where I say, "Yeah, I could totally do that myself." Honestly, I have no freaking idea what I'm doing, but at least I can share the knowledge after I've broken everything.

You may also find instances where my wife and I have both not had any idea what we were doing atÂ [At Our Own Risk](http://atourownrisk.blogspot.com/).
