This is a "double DIN" bezel/console -- actually, VW Golf sized -- from [tt8n.de](http://tt8n.de/) installed in a 2002 Audi TT, with a [JoyingÂ JY-VL130](https://www.carjoying.com/vestempcp/quickview/view/path/best-joying-2016-automotive-android-5-1-1-lollipop-vw-golf-passat-jetta-8-inch-car-head-unit-gps-navigation-system-audio-double-2-din-quad-core-hd-1024-600-car-stereo-autoradio-16-gb-support-mirror-link-google-play-store-backup-camera-for-2.html) VW-focused Android-based head unit.
