In non-mechanical repairs, finally had a chance to replace two issues on my vehicle, and one looks pretty awesome. First one was replacing the passenger side lower grille, where most cars would have a fog light. It was missing, and there was just one big stupid looking hole in the front. Second, I replaced the rear valance (lower bumper, surrounding exhaust pipes) with the one that came with the upmarket V6 model. It wasn't just for the look -- at some point, someone rear ended this car, likely before I owned it, and it was cracked and snapped from the retaining bolts. I'm just happy I didn't need a whole bumper.  
  
It looks great. Ignore the fact that I'm in the reflection.
