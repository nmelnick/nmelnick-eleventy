**Development and Workspace Tools**

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) \- Windows/Mac/Linux - Bar none, the best text editor around right now. I've been through a lot of them since the dawn of time, but it's remarkably fast especially considering it's an Electron app, the extension ecosystem is amazing, it's intuitive and fast to use, and available on three platforms. Still waiting for an official iPad release.

[IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) \- Windows/Mac/Linux - Some of my full time work is in Scala, and while the Scala support in VS Code is getting better, IDEA is far and away the best way to understand the calisthenics being done by that language, or any JVM language.

[Beekeeper Studio](https://www.beekeeperstudio.io/) - Windows/Mac/Linux - When I need to see my data more than the cli provides, Beekeeper Studioprovides a unified interface for tons of database servers. It's actively developed, open source, cross platform, and while it's a wrapped web application, it's very responsive.

[Windows Subsystem for Linux 2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/wsl-2-is-now-available-in-windows-insiders/) - Windows - A Linux kernel right along side Windows, allowing me to use all of the tools I'm used to and want, while still working in an environment with all of the applications I'd like to use.

[Windows Terminal](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/introducing-windows-terminal/) \- Windows - Finally, a first party, fast, GPU-accelerated terminal, supporting all of the different ways to get a shell on a Windows machine.

[Tilix](https://gnunn1.github.io/tilix-web/) - Linux - A multi-pane, tabbed terminal that sits nicely at home in the GNOME desktop environment on Linux

[iTerm 2](https://iterm2.com/) - Mac - Gives me an experience like the built in Terminal, while having more control over my tabs, split-panes, and it's free.

Bash + [powerline](https://github.com/powerline/powerline) \- Mac/Linux - All the cool kids are moving to zsh, but I have bash where I like it, and my neckbeard is bristling.

Git on the command line - Windows/Mac/Linux - Because I end up faster here than in a GUI tool.

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) \- Windows/Mac/Linux - Giving me the flexibility to try things out without breaking everything else, and the assurance that my deployment is going to look the same everywhere else.

Hyper-V and/or VirtualBox

**Productivity**

[Office 365](https://www.office.com/) \- I know, I know, but holy crap does it work surprisingly well, I have no problem paying that subscription

[1Password](https://1password.com/) - A surprisingly great, cross-platform password manager with cloud storage, with a user interface that doesn't get in the way and is occasionally consistent. It's too much money, and the UI might be Electron soon, but it's more reliable than Bitwarden for me

[Notion](http://notion.so) - I came across this trying to find a Confluence replacement, and found an incredible tool for organizing thoughts, projects, tasks, and data in one place, both personally and professionally.

Google Calendar - Most of my Google stuff has moved on, but Google Calendar is prolific and allows me to share calendars with my family and contacts easily.
